## Description

This app is a game that allows the user to select a number and the mobile devvide will try to guess the number. Each time the device makes an incorrect guess the user will indicate if the next guess should be higher or lower.

If the next guess should be higher and the user selects lower an alert will appear telling the user not to lie. The round number and device's guesses are displayed and when the device gets the correct number a new screen is displayed with the user's number and the number of rounds it took for the device to get the correct number.

There is also a 'Start New Game' button.
